A simple and helpful little mortgage project I created upon learning REACT.

This first REACT project of mine covers most basic principles and fundamentals about REACT, such as its behaviours and functionalities, components, useState hook and props handling.

It also showcases how simple yet efficient it is to use the library of prebuilt Material UI components for building nice looking minimalistic pages.

To use the Mortgage Calculator simply follow this steps:

- download this repository
- unzip the directory and save it wherever you wish to in your pc
- open the folder in vscode
- run npm install to assure that all latest versions of the dependencies are installed
- run npm start
